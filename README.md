# Data Scientist


## 👋 ABOUT ME  
**Data science + storytelling + problem-solving.** That’s my formula.  

Dashboards. Deep Learning. Decisions. I build data solutions that make noise in the boardroom.  

### What I bring to the table:  
- Sharp analytical skills backed by Python, SQL, and all things machine learning.  
- A knack for storytelling through data because 👉 numbers mean nothing if they don’t drive action.  
- A mix of curiosity and creativity that helps me spot insights others might miss. 

Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something awesome!
