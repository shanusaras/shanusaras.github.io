## Projects
### Hotel Revenue and Operational Efficiency Analysis
[Project link](https://github.com/shanusaras/Hotel-Revenue-and-Operational-Efficiency-Dashboard.git)

Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel chain, faced declining revenue due to rising competition and poor management decisions. Using Power BI, Excel, and DAX, I analyzed 12 months of booking data, uncovering key revenue drivers and inefficiencies. The insights revealed that Elite customers and the RT2 room type contributed significantly to revenue, while high cancellation rates impacted occupancy. My dashboard provided actionable strategies, including personalized marketing, optimized pricing, and stronger platform partnerships. These recommendations aimed to boost revenue, enhance customer retention, and improve operational efficiency.

### Loan risk Analytics and Performance Insights
[Project link](https://github.com/shanusaras/Loan-Risk-Analytics-and-Performance-Insights.git)

The Loan Risk Analysis and Performance Insights project examines 10,000+ loan records using MySQL to identify key risk factors, revealing that 13.8% of loans are high-risk due to factors like Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio and loan terms. The data was cleaned and transformed in Excel, uncovering trends through pivot tables and metrics. To enhance risk assessment, interactive Power BI and Tableau dashboards were developed, visualizing borrower behavior, loan performance, and regional trends. The findings provide actionable insights for financial institutions to reduce loan defaults, improve risk assessment, and offer better-targeted loan products. Future improvements include predictive modeling and real-time dashboard updates for enhanced decision-making.

### Mobile price range prediction and Business Insights for Competitive Strategy
[Project link](https://github.com/shanusaras/Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction.git)

The Mobile Price Range Prediction project leverages machine learning and data analysis to classify mobile phones into price ranges based on specifications like RAM, battery power, and internal memory. Using Python and libraries like Scikit-learn and XGBoost, the project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to ensure accuracy. After testing multiple models, a fine-tuned Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 95% accuracy, significantly improving price classification reliability. The analysis provided actionable business insights, helping a budding company optimize pricing strategies to compete with market leaders like Apple and Samsung. By identifying key pricing factors and consumer preferences, the project offers data-driven recommendations to maximize market penetration and profitability.

### Employee Performance Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Workforce Optimization
[Project link](https://github.com/shanusaras/Employees_performance_analysis.git)

The Employee Performance Analysis and Workforce Optimization project aimed to enhance workforce productivity and hiring efficiency at a prestigious company by leveraging advanced machine learning and data analytics. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, I conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to identify key performance drivers. Predictive models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, were optimized to achieve a 93% accuracy rate, enabling precise employee performance forecasting. Insights from the analysis helped improve hiring efficiency by 26% and increase client satisfaction by mitigating performance-related escalations. Additionally, actionable recommendations, such as incentive programs and skill development initiatives, were proposed to optimize employee retention and overall workforce efficiency.
